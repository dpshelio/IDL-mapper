IDL-mapper creates a graphivz representation of your IDL libraries

To run it you just need to have:
  * a linux bash (I've not tested in others yet)
  * python2
  * graphivz
  * pygraphivz (http://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/)

Then execute: 

  $ ./find_roots.sh IDL_test_lib  

where IDL_test_lib is the example library on the repository, but you can change it to the path of the library you want to plot.

Attention: depending on the library size it can take quite a while, and the plot may not be generated properly (and can get a few MBs).

For visualisation you can use any of the tools in:

ZGRViewer works quite well for me (http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html)
